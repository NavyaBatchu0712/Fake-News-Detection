# Fake News Detection using Various Attention Mechanisms and BERT

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting fake news by leveraging state-of-the-art attention mechanisms and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The goal is to develop robust models capable of accurately identifying misinformation in textual data.

## Attention Mechanisms Explored

The project explores the following attention mechanisms in conjunction with BERT for fake news detection:

- **Self Attention**
- **Self Attention + VGG16**
- **Co-Attention**
- **Co-Attention + ResNet**
- **Cross Attention**
- **Cross Attention + ResNet50**
- **BERT + Self Attention**

## Methodology

Each attention mechanism is implemented and evaluated for its effectiveness in distinguishing between real and fake news. The models are trained and tested on benchmark datasets, and their performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**

## Implementation Details
